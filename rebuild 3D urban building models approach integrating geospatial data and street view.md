# A large-scale 3D urban building model dataset integrating geospatial data and street view data

# 1 Background Description

​        As a realistic, stereoscopic, time-series reflection of the spatio-temporal information of human production, life, and ecological space, real scene 3D is an important new infrastructure of the country. It realizes the real-time connection and intercommunication between digital space and real-time space through "human-computer compatibility, IoT-sensing and ubiquitous services", and provides a unified spatial positioning framework and analysis foundation for Digital China. It is an important strategic data resource and production factor for digital government and digital economy, and is a specific deployment for the mapping and geographic information industry to implement the construction of new national infrastructure.   

However, the currently available real scene 3D modeling technologies (such as artificial modeling, oblique photography modeling, 3D reconstruction technology based on the laser point cloud, and parametric modeling based on vector data) generally have the problems of long modeling cycles, high costs and a limited scope, which cannot consider "modeling cost" and "visual feeling". Therefore, a method for creating large-scale 3D urban building models that integrate geographical data with street view data is suggested. Based on the massive multi-source heterogeneous big data including remote sensing images, open source vector layers, street view images, and video images, a large-scale 3D urban building model dataset integrating geospatial data and street view data is constructed. Its modeling cost for one square kilometer is one-tenth of oblique photography and one-fiftieth of fine modeling, and its construction time is one-hundredth of oblique photography modeling and one in five hundred of fine modeling.


# 2 Dataset Description

​    The large-scale 3D urban building model dataset integrating geospatial data and street view data is a selected collection of real scenes enhanced 3D model data (S3M format) that covers 34 cities in China, including 28 provincial capitals, 4 municipalities directly under the Central Government and 2 special administrative regions, with the advantages of a small amount of data, beautiful texture effect, high degree of realistic restoration, and so on. And it supports the SuperMap GIS platform, Unity, UE4, and other tools that can read S3M format data. Additionally, we will continue to release other common 3D format data such as FBX and OSGB.

## 2.1 Being consistent with the real geographical scene highly

​    The process of building this dataset is based on realistic, accurate, and current heterogeneous data, which makes the modeling highly restores the real scene. The model scenes are highly reproducible to real scenes at a large scale, and the style and color of individual buildings are also intuitively displayed at the mesoscopic level.

## 2.2 Complementing existing data

​    This dataset can supplement the existing 3D data in various locations and achieve 3D whole area coverage under cost control conditions owes to its fine and beautiful texture features and realistic visual effects, which make up for the lack of texture in the existing white film data and has similar results to the fine model data at certain scales.

## 2.3  Adaptable to multiple application requirements

​    This dataset considers the needs of "model cost" and "visual sense", and realizes the whole area coverage and a key expression of urban real scene enhanced 3D model, which can effectively serve the 3D display and application of land spatial planning, natural resources 3D application and 3D real estate business.
